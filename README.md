## About the Game

This was a self directed project creating a 2d game in Unity, over two terms working in class and outside of school. Facing many problems and overcoming them I have managed to create a fleshed out a playable state of the game. It is a game focusing on the player reaching a start point to end point while avoiding obstacles.

### Story and Objective

The goal is to complete all 6 levels including the boss fight.
